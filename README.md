Graphical checking for creating simple linear regression model
In this process we use a data from Excel (with high normality) for having a vision about graphical checking for creating simple linear regression between tree diameter and tree height (tree diameter is independent variable and height id dependent variable).
Why it is good to doing? Before creating any model we should to insure about our data and our analysis way.
packages:
1. ‘readxl’ for calling Excel file into R program
2. ‘e1071’ for checking skweness of distribution
Why these Functions:
Scatter smooth: Before than creating sample linear regression we need to know this: Is there a linear relationship between these two variables?
Box plot: We can understand about this: deos each variables have any outlier value?
Density plot: We can use this function to find out whether the data follows a normal distribution or not.
